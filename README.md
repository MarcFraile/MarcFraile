## About Me

I recently obtained a PhD from Uppsala University (Sweden). My thesis, *"Computer Vision and Explainability in Human-Human and Human-Robot Interaction"*, investigated the applicability of end-to-end Deep Learning techniques to predict social behavior during guided play. In my research, I primarily coded in Python, using common ML libraries (PyTorch, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, pingouin, etc.)

In a previous life, I was a backend developer at Klarna, building microservices in Java and related web technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy programming in C. Just a code editor, the command line, and the standard library. Good times.

## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at Uppsala University, working on Computer Vision applied to Social Robotics. My project, "Explainable deep learning methods for human-human and human-robot interaction", aims to use modern end-to-end techniques to detect and analyse emotional alignment during social interactions. The long-term goal is to apply these findings to social robots, so we can improve their conversational skills.
